Use the provided code to solve Sudokus. The file Sudoku.h contains the
interface. Use the following format for your code:


#include "Sudoku.h"
#include <queue>

ac3() {

}

int main() {
    Puzzles puz("sudokus.txt");
    Sudoku sud = puz.nextPuzzle();

    while(sud.valid) {
        //Your Logic
	//If it's solveable, print solution
        sud = puz.nextPuzzle();
    }

    return 0;
}



Note that a Sudoku is indexed using the [] operator with a string as the
index type.

There are also three potentially useful functions to return the indices
of all other cells in the same row/column/box as the argument.

Due to popular demand, the source code, Sudoku.cpp, is included. There
should be no need to alter Sudoku.cpp or Sudoku.h

In partII, it asks for a text file with a printout of all the solutions.
You should assign values to the sudoku and then use the provided print()
method to print the results. Then, redirect your output to a file:
       ./search > file.txt
